#vocabBook
A Node.js app (currently in development) that will allow you to create a digital vocab book for keeping track of new words you have learnt in another language!

It stores/retrieves data in a JSON file.  I am still developing it but the core functionality is there!

##Planned developments
- Adding quiz functionality to reinforce learning
- More presentational work on the UI
